Frequency is how often an event repeats itself over a set amount of time. In physics, the frequency of a wave is the number of wave crests that pass a point in one second (a wave crest is the peak of the wave). Hertz is the unit of frequency. All electromagnetic waves travel at the speed of light in a vacuum but they travel at slower speeds when they travel through a medium that is not a vacuum. Other waves, such as sound waves, travel at much much lower speeds and can not travel through a vacuum. Examples of electromagnetic waves are: light waves, radio waves, infrared radiation, microwaves, and gamma waves.
